Other types of chests will be available at a higher price and in smaller quantities at a later date",

Having purchased the NFT Chest at mint, you will receive a NEAR NFT representing this particular chest.\n\n## How to use?\n\nAny chest can be opened in the game at Global Launch date or re-sold anytime on Paras Marketplace now or in-game p2p NFT Market later.\n\n## Why buy now?\n\nNFT Chests pre-sale amounts will be limited to the drops stated in Roadmap. Every next pre-sale, the price of previous unsold chests (if there are any) will be increased. A new type of greater chests will be added every next presale. We are planning to complete all pre-sales before Global Launch, so the only way to obtain NFT Chests after Global Launch  will be to buy them from other people on the secondary market.\n\nNFT- items obtained from the Chests would be much more expensive after the game release date, as well as other NFT items in the game, due  to their unique performance characteristics and limited supply."
